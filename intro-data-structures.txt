1. A line of people at an amusement park ride.

The line is composed of members, represented as strings.
There is a front to the line, as well as a back.
When someone enters the line, place them at the end.
People may leave the line whenever they see fit, and those behind them take their place.
Given the above real-world information, use an array data structure to code the following solution.

a) Use an array input: ["Vivian", "Ava", "Josh", "Patrick", "Mike"]
b) Insert a new person, "Mary" at the end of the line. In other words, you should insert Mary after Mike.

line.push ("Mary");

c) Find a person in line named "Josh." This function should return the position of 2 in the array, (recall that arrays are 0-based).

function findPlace(name){
  return line.indexOf(name);
}

Instead of making a new function for each person I just made a generic function to find a person in the array for any name, instead of making a function for each persons name like I had before utilizing the DRY principle of not repeating the same code over again.

d) Find a person in line named "Emily." What should your function return if it does not find the item in the array?

It returns -1, which means that it is not in the array since arrays start at 0.

e) What if Ava wants to allow a friend, "Melissa", to cut in line in front of her? How would you code this so Melissa appears before Ava?

line.splice(1, 0, "Melissa");

f) If Patrick wants to leave the line, how would you delete him from the array?

line.splice(4,1);

2. Provide another real-world example that you can model using a data structure.

Another real world example that I can model using a data structure would be a family tree.

3. How would your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?

A data structure would allow developers to manipulate the data, by adding and deleting new family members to the family tree depending on their lineage.
